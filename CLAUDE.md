# How we work

This repo documents itself in three layers (see [docs/conventions/documentation.md](docs/conventions/documentation.md)):

- **Map** — [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) (hub) + [docs/architecture/](docs/architecture/) (area docs): where things are, present tense.
- **Rules** — [docs/conventions/](docs/conventions/): portable engineering rules, one topic per file.
- **Decisions** — [docs/adr/](docs/adr/): dated decision log, Proposed → Accepted → Superseded.

Terminology is governed by [docs/glossary.md](docs/glossary.md) — one canonical
name per concept, synonyms map into its table. Before coining a term in any doc,
discussion, or code identifier, check the glossary; new concepts get their row
added in the same change that introduces them.

## Before starting work

Check the current branch first. Starting from `main`/`master` is the normal case
(a feature branch gets created at commit time). On any other branch, ask the user
whether working on it is intended — they may have forgotten to switch back after
a merge.

Read the docs: the ARCHITECTURE.md hub, then the
[docs/architecture/](docs/architecture/) area doc for the area you're touching,
the conventions index ([docs/conventions/README.md](docs/conventions/README.md)),
and any ADRs near your change ([docs/adr/README.md](docs/adr/README.md)).
Subagents get the same instruction — point them at the specific area doc and
files relevant to their task.

## While working

Build aligned with what is already settled: Accepted ADRs and the conventions as
written are binding. Don't invent a new pattern where a documented one fits, and
don't update the docs mid-session — note discoveries and deviations as you go and
carry them to the end-of-session step.

### Verification cadence

Typecheck and tests are MILESTONE gates, not edit-by-edit reflexes. Run them
when a settled change-set is complete, or when actively chasing a concrete
failure — not after every file touched. During a large refactor the tree may
stay broken for a while by design; verify once when the agreed shape is in
place, not at every intermediate step. (Typecheck is cheap and may run more
freely while wiring imports; the full test suite is the milestone gate.)

### Git is read-only mid-session

No commits, no pushes, no staging beyond what file operations themselves
require (`git mv` / `git rm`). The session's work accumulates uncommitted so
the whole change is reviewable as one diff — mid-flight commits have
destroyed that audit trail before. Committing happens only in the
end-of-session step below, and only on the user's EXPLICIT commit signal:
"implementation looks good" or "docs confirmed" is not it.

## Settle, then move

When a question, objection, or correction is raised — about code or docs — the
debate comes first and the edits come after. Don't touch files while a decision
is still open; discuss until it's settled or the user explicitly says go. This
applies symmetrically: code changes wait for settled decisions, doc updates wait
for finished debates (or the user's "time to write docs" signal). Nothing is
marked Accepted until the user has actually read and confirmed it.

This applies to the INITIAL request too, not just mid-session objections. A bug
report or feature ask that sounds clear is not yet settled scope — the user's
idea often sharpens over the next few messages, and edits started in the middle
of that get rewritten. First investigate and debate: diagnose, lay out the
design and its consequences, surface the corner cases, and restate what will be
done — then start editing once the user confirms the shape. Reading code and
docs while the debate runs is fine; changing files is not.

### The alignment doc (`implementation.md`)

For work beyond a trivial change, once the design is discussed and settled,
write it to `implementation.md` at the repo root before building: what will be
done, the shape, the decisions, what we get. It is the shared-understanding
artifact the user reads to confirm we're aligned, and the working reference while
building (kept in sync as decisions shift). It is **never committed** — it's
gitignored, a scratchpad for the session, not part of the permanent record (the
ADRs + map are). Delete it once the work lands and the docs pass has captured the
durable decisions.

## When the user says it's time to write docs

This step runs only on the user's signal, at the end of a session:

1. **Update the map** — ARCHITECTURE.md reflects the code as it now is.
2. **Write new ADRs** for decisions made this session — status **Proposed**, one
   decision per file, added to the ADR README index. Supersede, don't rewrite.
   Gate every candidate through [ADR-0000](docs/adr/0000-adr-scope.md):
   architectural decisions only — bug fixes don't get ADRs (commit message +
   regression test + why-comment), and process changes amend this file instead.
3. **Add or amend conventions** for patterns discovered this session (new topic
   file, or an addition to an existing one — the qualifying bar is in
   [docs/conventions/README.md](docs/conventions/README.md)). State the
   candidates considered explicitly — "considered, none qualified" is a valid
   outcome; silently skipping the question is not. The set only grows when the
   question is actually asked, and sessions have skipped it before.
4. **Ask the user to confirm** the new ADRs and conventions. Confirmed → mark
   Accepted. Corrected → settle the corrected version, mark it Accepted, and apply
   it to the session's work so code and docs agree.

The distinction that makes this work: existing docs are **settled** — follow them
without debate, fast. New ADRs and conventions are **fluid** — drafted from what
the session discovered, and only become settled once the user confirms them. Next
session (and every subagent) then starts from the upgraded baseline.

## After everything is agreed

Commit and push the session's work:

- On `main`/`master`: create a new feature branch for the session's work first.
- On any other branch: stay on it — it's already the feature branch.
- Commit all the work (code + docs), then push with `./push.sh <branch-name>`
  (plain `git push` fails here — the SSH key isn't in the default agent).
