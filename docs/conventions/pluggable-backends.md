# Pluggable backends: one feature, a discriminant on the record, an adapter per backend

**Rule.** When a feature must speak to several interchangeable backends (databases,
storage providers, message queues, model hosts), build **one** feature with a
per-record discriminant naming the backend, and isolate each backend's library behind
a small adapter exposing a neutral interface. Never copy the whole feature per backend.
Code that is bundled for more than one target must not import a backend library.

## Rules

1. **The discriminant lives on the record, not the feature.** The unit of work (a
   connection, a bucket, a target) is what varies by backend, so the backend tag is a
   field on that record. A consumer names a record and the adapter layer resolves which
   backend is behind it — consumers never pick a backend-specific entry point.
2. **One adapter per backend, behind a neutral interface.** Define the few operations
   the feature actually needs (open / query / probe / close) as an interface; each
   adapter wraps one library and maps its native result onto a **neutral result type**.
   The rest of the feature — formatting, callers, tests — stays backend-agnostic and
   never branches on the discriminant.
3. **A `discriminant → adapter` map is the registry.** Adding a backend is a new adapter
   file, one map entry, and one union member — no edits to callers. (Folder-as-registry,
   [module-registries.md](module-registries.md); neutral result type,
   [canonical-shapes.md](canonical-shapes.md).)
4. **Validate and default the discriminant where records are stored.** Persisted records
   are untrusted: coerce an unknown backend value to a safe default, and derive
   backend-dependent defaults (ports, regions, limits) from the chosen backend.
5. **Keep cross-target-bundled code free of backend libraries.** Backend drivers are
   often platform-bound (Node-only). A module bundled into more than one target — e.g. a
   manifest compiled into both a main process and a renderer — must not import an
   adapter. Lift the per-backend plain data it needs (default ports, capability flags)
   into a dependency-free module both sides can read.

## Why

One-feature-per-backend duplicates everything the feature owns — UI, config, lifecycle,
tools — when the records differ only by which library opens them. It also leaks the
split to the user (toggle N features, mentally partition records by backend) and to any
agent or caller (choose among N near-identical entry points). Putting the discriminant
on the record collapses that to one surface: callers name a record, the adapter knows
the backend. A neutral result type is what keeps the collapse honest — without it the
"one feature" still branches on backend everywhere and you have N features wearing one
name. The bundling rule is the trap that bites last: a manifest or config module that
innocently imports an adapter drags a Node-only driver into a browser bundle and breaks
the build far from the edit.

## How to apply

- Name the operations the feature needs and nothing more; that interface is the adapter
  contract. Each adapter wraps one library and returns the neutral type.
- Put the backend discriminant on the stored record; default + validate it at the store
  boundary, and derive backend-specific defaults from it there.
- Resolve backend via a `discriminant → adapter` map. Adding one is a new file plus a
  map entry plus a union member — never a caller edit.
- Audit which modules are bundled for multiple targets; ensure none import an adapter.
  Per-backend constants those modules need live as plain data they can import freely.
